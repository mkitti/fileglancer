# for just those IDs.  LSF normally allows querying jobs by ID across
# users, so one worker's call returns statuses for all users' jobs.

       values merged with manifest defaults, across BOTH the pipeline

       default or an env-tab file parameter is mounted rather than left

       are not bind-mountable and would otherwise produce garbage binds.
    2. The runnable's explicit `bind_paths`.
    3. The cached repo clone, but only when the command runs from `repo`. The
       `repo` symlink lives inside the (already-bound) work dir yet points at
       the clone outside it, so without this bind the symlink dangles in the
       container and the `cd` into it fails. Container runnables default to
       `work`, so this is only added when the author opts into `repo`.
