"""URL helpers for serving app services behind an HTTPS reverse proxy.

A service job publishes ``http://<node>:<port><suffix>`` to its work directory.
When a proxy domain is configured, Fileglancer republishes that as
``https://job-<id>-<mac>.<proxy_domain><suffix>`` and tells the reverse proxy
which upstream the hostname maps to. These functions are the whole translation
layer between the two forms, kept pure so they can be tested without a database.

A published ``service_url`` may also carry HTTP Basic Auth userinfo (e.g.
``http://user:pass@node:port/``), for a service that enforces its own such
credential rather than a query-string token. ``build_proxied_service_url``
forwards it to the browser-facing URL; ``upstream_from_service_url`` discards
it, since nginx's ``proxy_pass`` target is only ever a bare ``host:port``.
