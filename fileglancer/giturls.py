    Strips a ".git" suffix and trailing slash, folds SSH forms to https, and

    representation. Any other branch is kept as "/tree/<branch>".

    Note the "main" folding is shorthand for "the default branch", which is only
    accurate for repos whose default actually is "main": a bare URL means "the
    default branch" while "/tree/main" means the main branch specifically, so for
    a repo defaulting to e.g. "master" these are different refs that this
    collapses together. Callers that need the real cloned revision in the URL
    resolve the default branch first (see canonical_app_url, fed by the
    worker-resolved branch) rather than relying on this. The frontend's
    buildGithubUrl/canonicalGithubUrl fold "main" the same
    way, and the "is it installed?" comparison depends on both sides matching.
