# HTTPS Proxy for App Services

Running app services (`type: service`) bind a port on a compute node and publish `http://<node>:<port>/...`. Set `apps.service_proxy_domain` to republish them over HTTPS at a per-job subdomain instead:

```
https://job-12-k7m2qhxr.services.example.org/lab?token=8f2c...
```

The `job-<id>-<mac>` label is signed with `session_secret_key`. Job ids are a small global sequence, so an unsigned `job-12` label would let anyone who can reach the proxy sweep `job-1`..`job-500` and find — and, for any service that does not enforce its own token, reach — every running service on the instance. The MAC is 8 base32 characters (40 bits); guessing it is online-only against a reverse proxy that answers 403, so a sweep of that space takes decades at 10k requests/second.

Design rationale: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-app-service-https-proxy-design.md`.

## What you need

- **A wildcard DNS record for the zone**, e.g. `*.services.example.org`, pointing at the Fileglancer host. No zone delegation is required — a wildcard may sit at any level (RFC 4592), so one record in the parent zone is enough:

  ```
  *.services   IN  A   <fileglancer host IP>
  ```

  A wildcard never matches its own parent, so this does not make `services.example.org` itself resolve. Add a plain `services IN A` record if you want the bare alias to work; the proxy does not need it.

- **A wildcard TLS certificate for that zone.** A wildcard matches exactly one label, so a certificate for `*.example.org` does **not** cover `job-1.services.example.org` — it must name the zone you actually use. If the host already serves a `*.example.org` certificate, the two coexist fine: two `server` blocks on port 443, each with its own `ssl_certificate`, selected by SNI. Leave `default_server` on the primary block.

- **A reverse proxy with `http_auth_request_module`** compiled in (`nginx -V | grep auth_request`).

## Fileglancer configuration

```yaml
session_secret_key: "<a long random string>"
apps:
  service_proxy_domain: "services.example.org"
```

Leave `service_proxy_domain` empty to disable; the direct `http://<node>:<port>` URL is then published unchanged.

`session_secret_key` is required when the proxy domain is set, and the server refuses to start without it. An unset key is generated at random per process, so under `uvicorn --workers N` each worker would sign hostnames with a different key and most proxied requests would be refused. Rotating it invalidates live service URLs, on top of the session revocation rotation already causes.

## Reverse proxy configuration

Fileglancer does not proxy the traffic itself. It exposes `GET /api/apps/resolve`, which reads the `Host` header and answers `204` with `X-Fg-Upstream: <host>:<port>`, or `403`. The reverse proxy resolves each request through it and connects to the upstream directly, so no proxied bytes pass through the application server.

Add a server block for the wildcard zone. This assumes a `map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade` block already exists at the http level:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name ~^job-\d+-[a-z2-7]+\.services\.example\.org$;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certs/services-wildcard.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/services-wildcard.key;

  location = /_fg_resolve {
    internal;
    proxy_pass              http://127.0.0.1:8989/api/apps/resolve;
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_set_header        Content-Length "";
    proxy_set_header        Host $host;
  }

  location / {
    auth_request     /_fg_resolve;
    auth_request_set $upstream $upstream_http_x_fg_upstream;

    # Required because proxy_pass targets a variable. Use whatever resolver the
    # host actually runs; 127.0.0.53 is systemd-resolved's stub.
    resolver 127.0.0.53 valid=30s;
    proxy_pass http://$upstream;

    proxy_set_header Host              $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;

    proxy_set_header Upgrade    $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_buffering    off;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
  }

  # A refused resolution means the service is gone, not that the user did
  # something wrong, so serve Fileglancer's explanation instead of nginx's
  # stock 403 page. The `=` makes the response carry the page's own 503.
  error_page 403 = /_fg_unavailable;

  location = /_fg_unavailable {
    internal;
    proxy_pass       http://127.0.0.1:8989/api/apps/service-unavailable;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
}
```

Also add this to the **main** server block, so the resolve endpoint is not reachable on the primary hostname:

```nginx
  location = /api/apps/resolve { return 404; }
```

Six details are load-bearing:

- **`internal;`** on the `/_fg_resolve` location makes it reachable only from nginx's own `auth_request` subrequest, never from a client. Together with the `return 404` in the main server block, it is what keeps the unauthenticated resolve endpoint off the network. Do not remove either.
- **`proxy_set_header Host $host`** passes the app subdomain through unchanged, so the app sees `Host` and `Origin` as the same value. This is what makes JupyterLab's WebSocket origin check pass without per-app configuration.
- **`resolver`** is mandatory. Without it nginx refuses to start when `proxy_pass` targets a variable.
- **`proxy_buffering off`** and the long `proxy_read_timeout` suit long-lived WebSocket and streaming sessions, such as the remote desktop app.
- **`proxy_intercept_errors` must stay off** (its default) for the `error_page 403` above to mean what it says. The 403 it catches is the one nginx generates when `auth_request` is denied; turning interception on would also catch a 403 from the app itself — a JupyterLab token rejection, say — and replace it with the "503 Service Unavailable" page.
- **`/_fg_unavailable` is a prefix location, not a named one**, because nginx refuses a `proxy_pass` with a URI part inside a named location (`proxy_pass cannot have URI part in location given by regular expression, or inside named location`). `internal;` is what keeps it out of the URL space the app sees, so a request for that path gets a 404 rather than the error page.

The existing HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect block is typically `default_server` with `server_name _`, in which case it already covers the new subdomains.

## Verification

Once DNS and the certificate are in place, launch each service app and confirm it loads and stays connected. WebSocket behavior is the thing to watch:

- JupyterLab — kernel connects, a cell executes.
- marimo — the notebook is interactive, not stuck "connecting".
- OpenVSCode — the editor loads and a terminal opens.
- Remote Desktop — the noVNC canvas renders and accepts input.
- TensorBoard — plots load.

If an app rejects the proxied origin, fix it in that app's manifest (most servers have an allowed-origin or base-URL option); do not weaken the proxy configuration.

## Residual risks

- Set `apps.service_proxy_upstream_zone` to the DNS zone your compute nodes live in, e.g. `nodes.example.org`. Without it the proxy will dial any host the Fileglancer host can reach, because the upstream comes from a file the user's job wrote. Loopback, the unspecified address, link-local (including cloud instance metadata), multicast and reserved addresses are always refused, since those are what reach the Fileglancer host itself. Private and public node addresses are allowed — an address on a routable interface is already reachable directly by any cluster user. Matching is on whole DNS labels, so a leading dot is optional and a sibling zone like `evil-nodes.example.org` does not qualify. The zone applies to hostnames only: a service that publishes the node's IP instead of its name is still accepted, so setting a zone will not break one. To confine those, set `apps.service_proxy_upstream_networks` to the CIDR networks your nodes occupy, e.g. `10.20.0.0/16`. The two settings divide the space between them — the zone governs upstreams published as names, the networks govern upstreams published as addresses — and each is empty by default, meaning no restriction on that form. Bad CIDR entries are refused at startup rather than at request time, since a typo there would otherwise reject every address upstream while looking configured.
- The signed hostname is not a substitute for a service enforcing its own token. It is unguessable, but a hostname leaks where a query string does not: plaintext SNI on the wire, DNS resolvers, and the proxy's own access log. Treat it as what makes enumeration infeasible, and `${FG_SERVICE_TOKEN}` as the credential. An app with no authentication of its own (TensorBoard, for one) is protected only by the label.
- A published `service_url` may instead carry standard HTTP Basic Auth userinfo (`http://user:pass@node:port/...`) for a service that enforces that rather than a query-string token — useful for services a CLI tool like `curl` also needs to authenticate against, not just a browser. It is forwarded to the proxied URL exactly like the query string is, and is never seen by nginx (only the bare `host:port` is used as the `proxy_pass` target). It is strictly weaker than a query-string token for anything embedded (JupyterLab, noVNC): browsers only honor `user:pass@host` on direct navigation to the link, not reliably inside an `iframe` or across a WebSocket upgrade, and some browsers show an interstitial warning or drop it across a redirect. It remains visible in the browser's address bar and history, the same class of exposure the query-string token already has.
- The resolve endpoint is called once per proxied HTTP request, so a single page load of an app like JupyterLab generates dozens. Successful resolutions are cached in-process for 10 seconds, which collapses that burst to roughly one database read per service per 10 seconds per worker. Refusals are deliberately not cached, so a service starts resolving the moment it publishes its URL. The endpoint is excluded from the per-request access log for the same reason and reports running totals once a minute instead — grep for `service proxy resolve totals` to see hits, misses and refusals by reason.
- That 10-second cache is also the window in which a job that has just stopped can still be proxied. Compute-node ports get recycled, so the window is kept short deliberately; if a port is reused within it, a client can briefly reach the new occupant, which will reject it for lack of that service's own token.
- A service that manages its own URL (`auto_url` unset) should write its URL file exactly once. The cached upstream is refreshed only while someone has the job's detail page open, so a URL that changes mid-run can go stale.
